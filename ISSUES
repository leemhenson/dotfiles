# khd

If it starts logging out "/bin/bash: khd: command not found" then you've probably upgraded khd and it has overwritten the changes you made to the plist to override the PATH envvar for that service. Back up the current plist and edit the one in /usr/local/Cellar/khd/<version> to add:

  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/bin/khd</string>
  </array>
  <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
  <dict>
    <key>PATH</key>
    <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin</string>
  </dict>

Then "brew services restart khd".
