# Expressions

Can be either variables, abstractions or combinations of both.

# Variables

Names for potential inputs to a function.

# Abstractions

An abstraction is a function, and consists of a head and a body:

λx.x

where λx is the head and x is the body

# Alpha equivalence

Refers to the fact that the variable names in an abstraction are meaningless, so the following are equivalent:

λx.x
λy.y
λz.z

# Beta reduction

The process of binding values to variables in the abstraction's head, and the substituting the occurrences of those variable names with those values in the body. The reduced form is the final substituted body.
