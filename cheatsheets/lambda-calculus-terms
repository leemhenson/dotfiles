# Expressions

Can be either variables, abstractions or combinations of both.

# Variables

Names for potential inputs to a function. Free variables are those that are not bound by an abstraction.

# Abstractions

An abstraction is a function, and consists of a head and a body:

λx.x

where λx is the head and x is the body

# Alpha equivalence

Refers to the fact that the variable names in an abstraction are meaningless, so the following are equivalent:

λx.x
λy.y
λz.z

# Beta reduction

The process of binding values to variables in the abstraction's head, and the substituting the occurrences of those variable names with those values in the body. The reduced form is the final substituted body.

# Beta normal form

When no more beta reduction can be applied to an expression, it is said to be in beta normal form.

# Combinators

A combinator is a lambda with no free variables, and serve only to combine their inputs without injecting new values or random data.

# Divergence

Not all lambdas can be reduced (aka converge) to a beta normal form, e.g. (λx.xx)(λx.xx), and these are referred to as divergent because the reduction process never ends.
